00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
Hi, everyone! it's Ken!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:12.860
Today, I'm heading out for some shopping.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:25.920
I'll be walking around the city and chatting in Japanese.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.790
So, let's go shopping together today!

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:44.050
It takes about an hour by train to get to the city from here.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.000
Today, I’m going to Taipei.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.790
Since I live in Taiwan now, I’ve been making a lot of videos about Taiwan lately.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.520
There are so many beautiful places in Taiwan.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:23.670
Oh, but in 2025, this year, I plan to go back to Japan for a short stay.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.620
When I visit Japan for trips, I’ll make a lot of videos there too.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:41.860
Please look forward to the Japan videos!

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:56.890
Alright, so first, I’ll take the train.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.410
It’s about a 10-minute walk to the station from here.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.900
Let’s head to the station first!

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.000
I’m getting on the train now.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.270
I just got off the train.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.650
It did take about an hour by train, as expected.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:41.000
So, this is the center of Taipei.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.820
There are so many people around.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:58.040
There are lots of shops in this area.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:06.800
Most of the shops around here are pretty high-end.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.280
They sell designer bags and accessories, 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.100
that kind of stuff.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:28.440
Not really my thing, but I’ll show you around a bit.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:46.070
Can you see? It looks like this.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.080
I’ve been here before.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.880
I think I’ve visited this area about twice.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.800
But it wasn’t for shopping.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.750
I came to see a famous building.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:20.590
We’ll get to see that building later, so let’s check it out together.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:33.920
This is one of the newer areas in Taipei.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.950
The buildings are new, and the streets are really clean.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:53.950
And yeah, a lot of the people walking around here are pretty fashionable.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.080
Christmas just ended recently.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.820
Even though Christmas is over,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.060
the lights are still up.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:28.910
They’re beautiful, aren’t they? Like this. Super pretty!

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:37.870
Do you guys like shopping?

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.970
Today, I came here to do some shopping.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.920
I came to buy something.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:59.140
What I’m buying today is a computer.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.500
I already have a laptop and

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:15.480
a tiny mini PC, like a small desktop computer.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.740
But that

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:27.760
small mini PC, the one like a desktop, broke.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:39.100
Since it’s broken, I’ve been looking for a new computer recently.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:52.540
And today, I’m going to buy a new computer.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.120
Actually, I already bought it.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:11.360
I looked it up online and paid with my credit card.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:27.110
But when I bought it, it was still just a pre-order.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:35.010
The store didn’t have it in stock.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:49.410
So today, I’m heading out to pick up the computer.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:58.410
Uh, wait a second. I’m not sure which direction to go.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:07.390
Was it this way? Or that way? I’m not really familiar with this area,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:16.930
so let me stop and check Google Maps. Hold on a sec.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.770
Alright, I just checked Google Maps.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.580
According to Google Maps,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:35.010
the store I’m heading to is straight ahead from here.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:43.410
It should be there if I just keep going straight.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:51.130
So yeah, I’m on my way now to pick up the computer I bought.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:09:02.590
Do you guys use computers for work?

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:09.830
Or even if it’s not for work, when you’re at home,

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.620
for example,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:24.640
do you watch movies or YouTube on your computer?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:32.160
I use my computer every day.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:41.570
I use my computer every day for work.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:49.340
So if my computer breaks, it’s a bit of a hassle.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:10:06.870
For me, it’s kind of a big deal.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:13.340
What have you guys bought recently?

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:25.910
Actually, you know, the computer that broke—I bought it about a year ago.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.800
I only bought it a year ago!

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:42.690
But it was really cheap, so I guess it can’t be helped.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.910
Yeah, no surprise it broke.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:55.580
What kind of computer do you guys use?

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:10.660
Can you guess what kind of computer I bought?

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:18.140
It’s a super famous computer.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:25.760
There’s an apple logo on it.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:33.820
Yep, I bought an Apple Mac mini.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:43.100
So now I’m heading to the Apple Store.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:56.030
Actually, up until now, I’ve only ever used Windows computers.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:07.940
The computers I have now are also Windows ones.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:16.960
A long time ago, when I was in high school...

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:24.060
I used a smartphone called iPhone 4S.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:38.720
Do you guys remember iPhone 4S? That was about 13 years ago?

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.780
I was in high school back then, so...

00:12:44.780 --> 00:13:00.560
all I needed my phone to do was make calls, send emails, and use social media with friends.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.500
That was good enough for me.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:12.930
So yeah, 12 or 13 years ago...

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:29.610
I don’t even remember if I liked the iPhone or not.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:37.760
I used the iPhone for about three or four years.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:44.770
Then, after my iPhone 4S broke...

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:50.030
I bought an Android phone.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:14:04.910
And ever since then, I’ve been using Android phones.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:22.500
Do you guys use Apple products like MacBooks or iPhones?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:28.960
Oh, look, there are some illuminations here too.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.020
The trees are all lit up.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:41.240
Illuminations! Oh, let’s go check that out!

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:47.830
Excuse me!

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.300
I came here to shop, but...

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:57.740
This area is so stylish. Can you see it?

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:04.450
This place is pretty stylish, isn’t it?

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:19.070
Right now, I’m filming while checking out the shops here.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:24.580
Wow, this place is really a city. A big one.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:29.020
And the buildings here are super tall!

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:39.970
I grew up in the countryside, so I’m not used to places like this.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:54.900
What about you guys? Do you like big cities like this?

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:06.680
I don’t usually go to big cities just to shop, but...

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:12.250
How about you?

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:18.290
When I need something or want something...

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:28.130
I try to buy it online as much as possible.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.570
When you buy online...

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:40.300
the delivery person brings it right to your door, doesn’t he?

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.740
That service is amazing!

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:50.340
It’s super convenient. Oh, hang on a second.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.890
I got lost again.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:17:00.870
Let me check Google Maps real quick.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:06.580
We’re almost there!

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:14.440
There is a really famous building in Taiwan over there.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.140
Let’s check it out together!

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.310
Can you see it? That building!

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:35.520
Whoa, it’s so tall! It’s called Taipei 101.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.120
That’s its Japanese name.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:50.170
Taipei 101. It’s the tallest building in Taiwan.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:18:01.700
It’s 508 meters (1,667 ft) tall. Wow, that’s really high!

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:22.880
It’s incredible! So impressive!

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:35.980
How tall is the tallest building or tower in your country?

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.490
Wow, this is amazing!

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:46.300
I’ve been to this area before.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:55.050
So, I’ve seen this building before.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:19:01.110
But no matter how many times I see it, it’s still impressive!

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.650
Inside this building...

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:16.120
there are shops, restaurants, and an observation deck, apparently.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:23.520
I guess the observation deck is up at the top.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:41.860
I’ve never been inside that building.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:48.750
That building.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:55.630
Actually, I’ve never gone inside it.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:00.980
But someday, I’d like to check it out.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.980
Today, though, I’m not going to Taipei 101.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:11.610
I’m heading to the Apple Store.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:24.230
I heard that the Apple Store is next to Taipei 101.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.320
That’s what my wife told me.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:38.440
Um, I think it’s over there. Probably over there.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:45.560
Oh, there it is! I’m going to pick up my computer now. Just a second!

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:54.020
Alright, I just got my computer!

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.180
Wow, I’m so excited!

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:06.730
I can’t wait to open it when I get home!

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:15.620
It’s evening now. After picking up this computer,

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:25.290
I ended up looking at iPhones, MacBooks, and other products.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:36.630
I checked out some other stuff too, and before I knew it, it got dark.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.240
It’s around 6 PM now.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.230
Almost 7 PM.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:56.510
I’m heading home now to unbox this computer!

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:02.940
I’m home!

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:15.360
Alright, let’s unbox this together!

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:24.480
This is my work desk.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:31.940
I usually teach Japanese lessons here

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:37.920
and edit YouTube videos.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:44.930
Oh, this desk is awesome!

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:58.760
When you press this button, it moves up automatically.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.520
Isn’t it cool?

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:17.250
Out of everything I bought last year, I’m happiest with this.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:21.790
Last year was 2024.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:35.070
This might end up being my best purchase of 2025.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:47.500
Well, 2025 has just started, though.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:56.210
Alright, let’s open this box now!

00:23:56.210 --> 00:24:00.260
How do I even open this?

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:07.200
Maybe here? Ah, yeah, that’s it.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.320
I pull here to open it. And then pull this side too.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:31.440
Then flip it over, and... wow! Nice!

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:38.500
It looks super beautiful!

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:49.630
Wow, looks great!

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:57.790
Apple’s designs are simple and nice! So cute!

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:04.640
It’s really small and cute!

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:16.480
And here’s the power cable inside.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:39.020
I’m not sure how to open this power cord packaging.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:45.920
What is this? What’s this for?

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:53.870
Oh, it’s the Mac mini manual! This is the manual.

00:25:53.870 --> 00:26:09.790
Since I went ahead and bought this, in 2025,

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.320
I plan to use this computer

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:20.470
to make lots of YouTube videos!

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:29.220
Please look forward to my YouTube videos this year too!

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:37.920
Have you guys bought anything recently?

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:48.680
If there’s something you bought recently that you’re happy with, let me know in the comments!

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.320
Alright, see you in the next video!

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.740
Bye!
